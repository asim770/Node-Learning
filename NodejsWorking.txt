Architecture of Node js
// 1. User request to the Server.
// 2. That request is sent to event queue.
// 3. Then there is event loop who watch over the event queue and take request from event queue (with fifo principal)
// 4. Then event loop check that this request is blocking (sync) or non-blocking (async).
// 5. If the request is async then it process the request and response to the user.
// 6. If the request is sync then this request is sent to thread pool (in thread pool there were threads who process the request).
// 7. If there was any free thread in thread pool it process the request then send to event loop then user get response.  
// 8. If no threads availabe then user need to wait. 

// Note:
// 1. That's why we  always need to code in async 
// 2. min. thread available is 4 maxHeaderSize. belong to the cpu. below code give the no. of thread acc. to my cpus which is 8

// console.log(os.cpus().length) // o/p 8
